# Clue Details

This plugin provides additional details on clue scrolls. This can be particularly useful for snowflake ironmen who can only do particular subsets of clues, allowing them to ignore ones they can't do.

**NOTE**: This plugin will only work for beginner and master clues after you have read them once. After that, the plugin should keep track of them as long as they are in your inventory, dropped by you, or banked.

## Marked Clues

There are configurable filter lists you can set up to enable highlighting of clues you've chosen. Use filters in the sidebar to easily find the clues you're interested in highlighting.

You can also easily mark and unmark clues by shift-clicking one already on the floor or in your inventory.

As the hints appear if you hover over the menu option for a clue, it can make it easier to identify which clue is which in a big stack of clues.

## Overlays

The "Show hover text" toggle will provide an infobox letting you know the step's details when you hover over a clue scroll.

The "Show clue tags" toggle in the plugin's settings renders the details on the clue item in your inventory.

- This is most useful when using shorthand details rather than with the default details. See link in Import/Export section.
- Text following the "Clue tag split sequence" configuration will be automatically split to the bottom of the clue item. The default is ":".

The "Show clues overlay" toggle in the plugin's settings renders the details as an infobox for all clues in your inventory.

The "Change clue item text" toggle in the plugin's settings makes it so the actual text of the clue item is adjusted, so you don't even need to hover for details.
