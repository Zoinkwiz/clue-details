# Clue Details

This plugin provides details on clue scrolls whilst they're on the floor. When you hover over a clue scroll, you'll get an infobox letting you know the step's details. This can be particularly useful for snowflake ironmen who can only do particular subsets of clues, allowing them to ignore ones they can't do.

There is also configurable filter lists you can set up to enable highlighting of clues you've chosen. There are pre-made lists of clues which can be useful, available below.
